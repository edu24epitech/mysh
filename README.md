# mysh

**mysh** is a custom Unix shell developed in C, inspired by the TCSH shell. Designed as a robust and interactive command-line interpreter, it replicates many features of a standard shell with additional support for job control, globbing, line editing, and command history.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Execute binary commands using environment PATH or direct paths
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `exit`
- Command separators using semicolons (`;`)
- Pipe support (`|`) between multiple commands
- Redirection support:
  - Output redirection: `>`
  - Input redirection: `<`
  - Append redirection: `>>`
  - Heredoc redirection: `<<`
- Proper signal and error management
- Returns the correct exit status from executed commands

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Language**: C (libC + ncurses)
